# Back In Stock - REST API Benchmarking Tool

This Java application implements an simple benchmarking tool that measures performance of the single publicly exposed endpoint: submitting a new notification.

This documentation is not complete. The application is unstable and under active development.

## Prerequisites

1. Java
2. Gradle
3. Internet connection

## Installing

1. Compile the application
    * Run the command `./gradlew bootRun` (will compile and run) or
    * Build an executable JAR file using `./gradlew build`, which will create a JAR file in `./build/libs/notification-service-0.1.0.jar`

## Deployment

Run the JAR file. If the JAR file does not execute on your system, execute the application with the command `java -jar build/libs/restapi-benchmark-0.1.0.jar`. You may need to remove the `executable = true` line from `build.gradle` and recompile the application first.
